# Dan Li's Personal Website



## Introduction
I built this website to record my learning process and share some ideas. I hope my knowledge could be consolidated by representation and I'd like to write some thoughts which I don't want to show in social media. 

Another reason is that I could show my projects and resume on my website. And hopefully it can help me get a jod :)
## Installation
I contained the installation source in the license, and you can find more information by folloing the link.
